INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PYTHON PROJECT

This is a simple python information retrieval project in which are used matplotlib and numpy python libraries in order to retrieve and analyse the given text file.
This project has two main goals : 

• Finding the value of the constant of Zipf's law . 


Zipf's law states that given a collection of documents written in natural
language, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its position in the
ordered (in non-ascending order) frequency table. You can find more about Zipf's law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law .

• Creating a [term vs. frequency] diagram with the 50 most used words .


This diagram is plotted using the matplotlib python library .

You can find the novel used (in plain text) in the novel.txt file .
